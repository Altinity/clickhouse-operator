# `clickhouse-operator` configuration

## Introduction

`clickhouse-operator` can be configured in a variety of ways. Configuration consists of the following main parts:
1. Operator settings -- operator settings control behaviour of operator itself.
1. ClickHouse common configuration files - ready-to-use XML files with sections of ClickHouse configuration **as-is**.
Common configuration typically contains general ClickHouse configuration sections, such as network listen endpoints, logger options, etc. Those are exposed via config maps.
1. ClickHouse user configuration files - ready-to-use XML files with sections of ClickHouse configuration **as-is**
User configuration typically contains ClickHouse configuration sections with user accounts specifications. Those are exposed via config maps as well.
1. `ClickHouseOperatorConfiguration` resource.
1. `ClickHouseInstallationTemplate`s. Operator provides functionality to specify parts of `ClickHouseInstallation` manifest as a set of templates, which would be used in all `ClickHouseInstallation`s.   

## Operator settings

Operator settings are initialized in-order from 3 sources:
* `/etc/clickhouse-operator/config.yaml`
* etc-clickhouse-operator-files configmap (also a part of default [clickhouse-operator-install.yaml][clickhouse-operator-install.yaml]
* `ClickHouseOperatorConfiguration` resource. See [example][70-chop-config.yaml] for details.

Next sources merges with the previous one. Changes to `etc-clickhouse-operator-files` are not monitored, but picked up if operator is restarted. Changes to `ClickHouseOperatorConfiguration` are monitored by an operator and applied immediately.

`config.yaml` has following settings:

## ClickHouse Installation settings

Operator deploys ClickHouse clusters with different defaults, that can be configured in a flexible way. 

### Default ClickHouse configuration files

Default ClickHouse configuration files can be found in the following config maps, that are mounted to corresponding configuration folders of ClickHouse pods:
* etc-clickhouse-operator-confd-files
* etc-clickhouse-operator-configd-files
* etc-clickhouse-operator-usersd-files

Config maps are initialized in default [clickhouse-operator-install.yaml][clickhouse-operator-install.yaml].

### Defaults for ClickHouseInstallation

Defaults for ClickHouseInstallation can be provided by `ClickHouseInstallationTemplate` it a variety of ways:
* etc-clickhouse-operator-templatesd-files configmap
* `ClickHouseInstallationTemplate` resources.

`ClickHouseInstallationTemplate` has the same structure as `ClickHouseInstallation`, but all parts and fields are optional. Templates are included into an installation with 'useTemplates' syntax. For example, one can define a template for ClickHouse pod:

```apiVersion: "clickhouse.altinity.com/v1"
kind: "ClickHouseInstallationTemplate"

metadata:
  name: clickhouse-stable

spec:
  templates:
    podTemplates:
      - name: default
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: clickhouse-pod
              image: yandex/clickhouse-server:19.11.8.46
```

Template needs to be deployed to some namespace, and later on used in the installation:
```
apiVersion: "clickhouse.altinity.com/v1"
kind: "ClickHouseInstallation"
...
spec:
  useTemplates:
    - name: clickhouse-stable
...
```

[clickhouse-operator-install.yaml]: ../deploy/operator/clickhouse-operator-install.yaml
[70-chop-config.yaml]: ./chi-examples/70-chop-config.yaml
