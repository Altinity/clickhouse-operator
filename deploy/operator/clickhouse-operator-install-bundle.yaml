                     - When `stop` is `0` operator sets `Replicas: 1` and `Pod`s and `Service`s will created again and all retained PVCs will be attached to `Pod`s.

                     - When `stop` is `0` operator sets `Replicas: 1` and `Pod`s and `Service`s will created again and all retained PVCs will be attached to `Pod`s.

                    Command within ClickHouse container is modified with `sleep` in order to avoid quick restarts
                    and give time to troubleshoot via CLI.

                        every key in this object is the file name
                        every value in this object is the file content
                        you can use `!!binary |` and base64 for binary files, see details here https://yaml.org/type/binary.html
                        each key could contains prefix like USERS, COMMON, HOST or config.d, users.d, cond.d, wrong prefixes will ignored, subfolders also will ignored

                        any key could contains `valueFrom` with `secretKeyRef` which allow pass values from kubernetes secrets
                        secrets will mounted into pod as separate volume in /etc/clickhouse-server/secrets.d/
                        and will automatically update when update secret
                        it useful for pass SSL certificates from cert-manager or similar tool

                     - When `stop` is `0` operator sets `Replicas: 1` and `Pod`s and `Service`s will created again and all retained PVCs will be attached to `Pod`s.
