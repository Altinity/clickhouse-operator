                     - When `stop` is `0` operator sets `Replicas: 1` and `Pod`s and `Service`s will created again and all retained PVCs will be attached to `Pod`s.

                     - When `stop` is `0` operator sets `Replicas: 1` and `Pod`s and `Service`s will created again and all retained PVCs will be attached to `Pod`s.
