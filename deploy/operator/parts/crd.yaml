                     - When `stop` is `0` operator sets `Replicas: 1` and `Pod`s and `Service`s will created again and all retained PVCs will be attached to `Pod`s.

                    Allows to troubleshoot Pods during CrashLoopBack state.
                    This may happen when wrong configuration applied, in this case `clickhouse-server` wouldn't start.
                    Command within ClickHouse container is modified with `sleep` in order to avoid quick restarts
                    and give time to troubleshoot via CLI.
                    Liveness and Readiness probes are disabled as well.

                                 - When `stop` is `0` operator sets `Replicas: 1` and `Pod`s and `Service`s will created again and all retained PVCs will be attached to `Pod`s.

                              attempt to retrieve any existing PDB. If none is found, it will create a new one

                              will remain intact, and the reconciliation loop will not be executed. By default,

                     - When `stop` is `0` operator sets `Replicas: 1` and `Pod`s and `Service`s will created again and all retained PVCs will be attached to `Pod`s.

                                 - When `stop` is `0` operator sets `Replicas: 1` and `Pod`s and `Service`s will created again and all retained PVCs will be attached to `Pod`s.

                              During the next installation, if PDB management is enabled, the operator will
                              attempt to retrieve any existing PDB. If none is found, it will create a new one
                              and initiate a reconciliation loop. If PDB management is disabled, the existing PDB
                              will remain intact, and the reconciliation loop will not be executed. By default,
                              PDB management is enabled.

                    Allows to stop all ClickHouse clusters defined in a CHI.
                    Works as the following:
                     - When `stop` is `1` operator sets `Replicas: 0` in each StatefulSet. Thie leads to having all `Pods` and `Service` deleted. All PVCs are kept intact.
                     - When `stop` is `0` operator sets `Replicas: 1` and `Pod`s and `Service`s will created again and all retained PVCs will be attached to `Pod`s.

                    Suspend reconciliation of resources managed by a ClickHouse Keeper.
                    Works as the following:
                     - When `suspend` is `true` operator stops reconciling all resources.
                     - When `suspend` is `false` or not set, operator reconciles all resources.
